# Programming for Discrete Math in Research
This is the git repository for a course taught at IMSc by Areejit Samal and Amritanshu Prasad.

## Workflow for homework:

1. Create an account on https://www.github.com
1. Install git on your local machine; see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git and https://git-scm.com/video/get-going
1. You will receive a link for each assignment; for the first assignment, it is https://classroom.github.com/a/ugoJSZ8I.
1. In your web browser navigate to that link
1. Accept the assigment
1. This will create a repository just for you - something like https://github.com/ProgrammingForDiscreteMath/20170821-YOUR-USER-NAME
1. Create a directory in your computer for this course and switch to that folder
1. Clone this repository onto your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingForDiscreteMath/20170821-YOUR-USER-NAME` (copy the URL from your web browser)
1. A new subdirectory will be created. This is actually a git repository. It's name will be something like `20170821-YOUR-USER-NAME`.
1. Enter this directory and work on your assigment; instruction will be found in the file `README.md`.
1. You can check the files which have changed using `git status`
1. You can view the changes you have made using `git diff`
1. Ask git to track all changed files using `git add .`.
1. Commit changes using `git commit -m "Completed assignment"`; the text in the quotes can be any message you wish to type.
1. Now push your completed assignment to github using `git push` (from the same subdirectory).
